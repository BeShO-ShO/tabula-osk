# Changes

## 1.4.1 (2026-11-14)
- **The keyboard pops up when you expect it, and not when you don't** (auto-show fixes, found while using TouchUp's
  swipe navigation and Dash to Dock):
  - Opening the overview (Activities, a swipe up from the bottom edge, the dock's app grid button) no longer opens the
    keyboard, even when the app behind it has a text field focused. Tap the search box to type.
  - Moving from one app's text field straight into another app's (for example Chrome → Terminal) opens the keyboard on
    the first tap. Before, it took a second tap, because the shell shares one text focus between all apps.
  - A window chosen in the overview, from the dock or by switching workspace still doesn't open the keyboard by itself,
    but the first tap inside it now does when its text field has the focus (some apps, such as Ptyxis, only ask for the
    keyboard from the second tap on).

## 1.4.0 (2026-11-14)
- **Swipe typing** (English, off by default: Settings → Typing Help → *Swipe typing*). Slide across the letters and lift
  your finger: the word is typed with a space after it, with a space first when it follows another word. A trail follows
  the finger. Capitals follow Shift, Caps Lock and the start of a sentence, and the next-word list gives expected words a
  small push.
  - Three other guesses appear in the suggestion bar; tap one to swap it in. One of them always starts on a key next to
    where the swipe began, in case the first letter was missed.
  - **Backspace right after a swipe deletes the whole word** (and forgets the word pair). Only the first key press after
    the swipe does this, and only while the text before the cursor still ends with that word.
  - A tap, a hold for accents (and sliding inside the accent row) and fast two-thumb typing work as before; a touch
    becomes a swipe only after the finger leaves the key. Works on the Tablet and US layouts and in custom layouts.
    With swipe typing on, held letters no longer repeat.
  - The decoder (`swipe.js`) is a JavaScript port of FlorisBoard's statistical glide typing classifier (Apache-2.0),
    retuned: word frequency weighs less, every key around the start and end of the swipe is considered, and the ends of
    the swipe count extra. On simulated swipes it picks the right word about 9 times in 10 in about 3–8 ms.

## 1.3.0 (2026-11-12)
- **Settings window reorganized** into one scrolling page (no tabs) with five sections: **When It Appears**, **Size and
  Position**, **Layout**, **Typing Help** and **Appearance**. Options that depend on another one sit inside it and are only
  shown when it is on; long explanations moved into (i) popovers that also work with touch. The window can be searched.
- One **Placement** choice (Floating / Docked / Docked, full width / full width with keys centered) replaces the three dock
  switches; the width setting is greyed out when it has no effect. **Height** and an optional **separate portrait height**
  can now be set in the settings as well as with the drag bar.
- Font: one row instead of two. It says when Atkinson Hyperlegible Next is not installed and the system font is used.
- **Layout Studio** opens as a sub-page from the Layout section. *Save and Use* sits in its header bar; *Start over from* US or Tablet
  asks before discarding unsaved edits; a deleted key can be restored with *Undo*; new keys are added after the selected one.
- The Italian layout is no longer offered in the settings (it stays in the code and is listed only if it is the layout in
  use). New installs start on the Tablet layout, cycling between US and Tablet.
- README: all screenshots retaken (Tablet with suggestions, long-press accents, Fluent US TKL, settings, Layout Studio);
  the old demo images from the original project are gone.

## 1.2.0 (2026-11-06)
- **Renamed to Tabula OSK** (was Apropos OSK, which also clashed with the `apropos` command). New extension ID
  `tabula-osk@besho-sho`, settings schema `org.gnome.shell.extensions.tabula-osk`, config folder `~/.config/tabula-osk/`,
  repository `BeShO-ShO/tabula-osk`. On its first start Tabula OSK copies the settings (dconf
  `/org/gnome/shell/extensions/apropos-osk/`), learned words and custom layout from Apropos OSK, and turns the old
  extension off if it is still enabled.
- Layout editor: **Reset to Tablet** button (next to Reset to Italian / US). A custom layout started from it keeps the Tablet
  layout's long-press symbols, corner hints and keys like Tab and Caps Lock.

## 1.1.2 (2026-11-06)
- **Tablet layout reworked after Gboard's tablet keyboard** (12 units per row): `` ` `` and Backspace frame the number row;
  Tab (hold for Esc) and a `|` key (Shift gives `\`, new `invShift` key property) frame the q row; Caps Lock and a wide Enter
  frame the home row (double-tap Shift still gives Caps Lock); `/` (Shift `?`) on the bottom row between Super and Space.
  Letter hints follow Gboard, but no symbol appears twice (anything a key types with Shift is not repeated as a hint; `?` on
  `m` is the one kept on purpose). Hold `,` = Ctrl+. (emoji chooser in GTK apps); hold `.` = `./`, `../`, `~/`, `.com`
  (new `noAccents` key property skips GNOME's extras). Backspace uses the modifier-key colour.
- **Compact header**: word suggestions now sit in the header row between the layout button and the Cfg/Dock/Width/Close
  buttons (no separate suggestion bar), and the resize/move handle is a small centred pill.
- **Taps in empty space go to the nearest key** (like Gboard): the strip below the bottom row, the gaps between keys, the side
  padding and the half-key indent. A tap just under the space bar types a space. Not the header, suggestions or handle.
- New setting **Layouts in the header toggle** (`layout-cycle`): choose which layouts the layout button at the top left
  cycles through.
- The **Keyboard height (%)** setting is removed: the height is set by dragging the bar at the top of the docked keyboard
  (stored separately for landscape and portrait).
- Fixed: a resize drag only ended when the finger was lifted over the (thin) drag bar; a missed release left a temporary
  height in place, so later height changes did nothing. The drag now follows the finger or mouse button until it is lifted
  anywhere, and closing the keyboard mid-drag keeps the dragged height.
- Show/hide fixes:
  - Volume, power and brightness buttons and other switches report themselves as keyboards; pressing them no longer hides
    the keyboard as if the Type Cover were used, or stops it from opening on the next touch.
  - Tapping a text field that already has the focus opens the keyboard again (apps that ask for an on-screen keyboard on
    tap, e.g. GTK and Chromium-based apps), also after closing it with ✕.
  - A brief focus loss (shorter than the hide delay) no longer stops the keyboard from hiding later, or from hiding on a
    Type Cover key.
  - No pop-up keyboard after switching workspaces or tapping the dock: opening automatically needs a tap in the window that
    gets the focus.
  - GNOME's own keyboard (used in system dialogs) is hidden before it is turned off. Destroying it while visible left a signal
    handler behind that logged errors to the journal, and could leave fullscreen unredirect disabled.
- **Typing Booster suggestions back in the keyboard instead of next to the text**: on GNOME 51 a slow first start of
  Typing Booster times out, the Shell falls back to plain xkb and its record of the active engine can stay wrong after
  Typing Booster does come up. The keyboard now follows the real IBus engine, sends candidates to its own bar whenever
  Typing Booster runs while it is open, adopts an engine left running, asks again if the start fell back, and restores the
  input source's engine after closing if Typing Booster is still active.

## 1.1.1 (2026-11-04)
- **GNOME Shell 51** support (Fedora 45): uses `global.stage.context.get_backend()` instead of the removed
  `Clutter.get_default_backend()`, and `orientation` instead of `St.BoxLayout`'s `vertical` property.
- **Next-word prediction fixed after completing a word from Typing Booster's suggestions**: the engine wraps each suggestion
  label in invisible direction marks (U+202A…U+202C) that are not part of the committed text; the keyboard kept them in its
  record of the typed text, so the word was not recognised and no next word appeared (and the pair was not learned).
  The bar also refreshes when the engine finishes the word (commit / preedit cleared), not just right after the tap.
- Bundled next-word list doubled to **3,000 words** (`next-words-en.txt`, ~100 KB).
- Tablet layout: corner hints for long-press keys (↵ shows Tab / Esc, ▲ PgUp, ▼ PgDn; readable on the blue Enter key).
  Long-press ▼ now starts on **PgDn** (popup order unchanged: ⇧PgDn, PgDn); new `lpDefault` key property picks the entry
  highlighted when the popup opens, which stays chosen until the finger slides sideways.

## 1.1.0 (2026-11-03)
- New layout **Tablet (US, Gboard style)** (setting value `phone`): number row; tablet arrangement with Backspace at the end of
  the q row and a wide Enter at the end of the home row (a row apart), Shift on both sides with `,` `.` beside `m`,
  and Ctrl, Super, Space, ▲, ▼ at the bottom. Half-key indent on the home row (new `spacer` key type).
- **Long-press** on the Tablet layout: corner symbol + accents from GNOME's own OSK data
  (`/usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-osk-layouts.gresource`, read at runtime). Characters without a key are typed like the
  stock keyboard does: through Typing Booster when it is active, as an input-method commit in text fields, or as keyvals.
  A second touch while a key waits for long-press turns it into a normal tap (fast two-thumb typing).
  Double-tap Shift = Caps Lock on the Tablet layout. Settings `long-press`, `long-press-delay`.
- **Material theme** (`theme` = `fluent` | `material`), follows `org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme`.
- **Auto-capitalization** (`auto-capitalize`): Shift latches by itself at sentence start / empty field and only shifts
  letters. Uses the text the keyboard typed, else the app's surrounding text.
- **Double-space period** (`double-space-period`).
- **Autocorrect** (`autocorrect`, English; stays off when the system language is not English): `enchant-2 -a` pipe (spell.js) decides, `words-freq-en.txt` ranks
  (textlogic.js), candidates are re-checked with Enchant. Replacement uses delete-surrounding + commit after verifying the
  app's text, else Backspace + retype when the word start is known. Backspace right after a correction reverts it and
  remembers the word.
- Activities search: the overview counts as a shell field even before its search entry has focus, so Typing Booster steps aside
  and auto-capitalization stays off there (the first letter typed on the OSK was lost).
- **Next-word prediction**: after a space (or at the start of a sentence) the suggestion bar offers the likely next word;
  tapping one types it plus a space. Learns word pairs typed with the OSK (`~/.config/apropos-osk/learned-pairs.json`),
  also reads the pairs Typing Booster has learned (its user.db, read-only), and starts from a bundled list of
  common pairs for 1,500 words (`next-words-en.txt`, ~50 KB, built from Tatoeba sentences; nouns are offered after "the", "a", "my"...). Works with and without Typing Booster; never in password/terminal/URL fields or Shell entries.
  Autocorrected words are learned as corrected; tapping a Typing Booster candidate no longer loses the typing context.
- Built-in suggestions use the frequency list for less common words (instead of the alphabetical Hunspell list).
- Tablet layout: separate ▲ / ▼ keys, Left/Right by sliding on the wide space bar; long-press ↵ for Tab / Esc (new `lpKeys`
  key property); Shift shows Caps Lock (lit, ⇪) after a double tap. New `split: [code, code]` key property (one key, top
  half / bottom half) for custom layouts.
- Tablet layout: Super key (❖) next to Ctrl. Tap = Super (Activities; hold it while tapping a key for Super+key);
  long-press = sticky Alt (key lights up and reads "Alt"; tap it to release). New `lpAlt: true` key property for custom layouts.
- Tablet layout: long-press ▲ / ▼ for PgUp, ⇧PgUp / PgDn, ⇧PgDn (Shift+PgUp/PgDn scrolls terminal history, e.g. Ptyxis).
  `lpKeys` entries accept `shift: true`.
- Typing Booster: a slow first engine start (longer than the Shell's 4 s limit) no longer leaves words stuck in
  preedit with an empty suggestion bar. Shell entries (app search, run dialog) use plain xkb so search filters on
  every letter instead of only after Enter/Tab.

## 1.0.1 (2026-11-03)
- Short key-release and auto-pair timers are now cancelled when the extension is
  disabled, and any key still held is released. Needed for extensions.gnome.org review.
- Release workflow updated to the Node 24 versions of its GitHub Actions.

## Typing Booster suggestions (2026-11-02)
New setting `use-typing-booster` (default off), switch "Use Typing Booster for
suggestions" in Settings, under "Word suggestions" (needs word suggestions on).

- No input-source change. GNOME 50 already has an "OSK completion" mode in
  `misc/ibusManager.js` (`setCompletionEnabled`). When the keyboard opens, it switches the IBus
  engine to `typing-booster`. When the keyboard closes, it switches back to the previous xkb
  engine (`xkb:us::eng`). This is the same mechanism the stock GNOME keyboard uses.
- If the current engine is not xkb (e.g. a CJK IBus engine), or typing-booster is missing,
  nothing is switched and the built-in suggestion bar is used.
- Candidates come from the Shell's own candidate popup, which passes each candidate to
  `Main.keyboard.addSuggestion(text, callback)`. Tapping one runs the Shell's callback,
  `panelService.candidate_clicked(i, 1, 0)`.
- Six slots, ordered left to right by rank 6 4 1 2 3 5 (typing-booster's page size is 6).
  The built-in list keeps its three middle slots with the best word in the centre.
- While this is active, the Shell's floating candidate popup is kept closed. The IBus `OSK`
  capability is also set, as the stock keyboard does. With that bit, typing-booster: adds
  a space after a tapped candidate, never commits candidates on digit keys, shows candidates
  without delay, and switches itself off in terminals.
- All hooks are instance overrides and are removed again on close or disable, or when the
  setting is turned off.
- Privacy: no text or candidates are logged. typing-booster switches itself off for
  PASSWORD/PIN fields and records nothing for SENSITIVE_DATA/PRIVATE fields.
  `_tsFieldAllowed()` still hides the bar in password, PIN, terminal, URL, e-mail and number
  fields.

Code: `TypingBoosterBridge` at the top of `keyboard.js`, plus `_tb*` methods and small hooks
in the `_ts*` methods. `prefs.js` has the switch, and the schema has the key.

## Undo
- Typing Booster: turn the switch off. The built-in bar then works exactly as before.
- Everything (the rename included): restore from `~/apropos-osk-backup/`. The pre-rename
  archive holds the old extension folder with all its earlier backup files.

## Fix: Chrome address-bar autocompletion (2026-11-03)
With Typing Booster on, letters typed in Chrome's address bar were held as an IBus preedit
(composition). Chrome's inline completion (the highlighted part) then could not be accepted:
Right/Tab did nothing and Enter only used the typed text.
- typing-booster is now only switched on in fields whose purpose/hints allow it
  (`_fieldTypeAllowed()`): not in URL, e-mail, password, PIN, terminal, number, phone or
  sensitive/hidden fields. Plain xkb is used there, so keys reach the app directly.
- The engine is re-checked on `notify::content-purpose` / `notify::content-hints` of
  `Main.inputMethod`, so moving between a page field and the address bar switches correctly.
- `_tsFieldAllowed()` now reads the Clutter-side `contentPurpose`/`contentHints` instead of
  the IBus copies (`im._hints` uses different bit values, so the old SENSITIVE_DATA check
  never matched).
- Backup: `~/apropos-osk-backup/keyboard.js.pre-urlfield-20261103-000316`
